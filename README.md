This is a twitter like app called Yodel.

in the backend I have several routes that handle
regestering,
logging in,
creating a new Yodel,
looking up all Yodels,
looking up all Yodels by a specific user,
looking up a Yodel by a specific Yodel id,
listing all Yodels with a search function,
following other users (adding them to an array of who a user follows),
unfollowing a user from a users array of who they follow.

the backend connects to a database using prisma.
